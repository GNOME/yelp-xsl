yelp-xsl is a collection of programs and data files to help you build,
maintain, and distribute documentation. This package is entirely free
software; however, not all components of the package are under the same
free software license.

The GNU General Public License and the GNU Lesser General Public License are
used for particular components of this package, depending on need. You should
have received a copy of both licenses with this package; see COPYING.GPL and
COPYING.LGPL. If you did not receive these files, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

This document attempts to provide a brief overview of the programs in this
package and their licensing terms.


XSLT
----
This package contains various XSLT files for transforming DocBook, Mallard,
and other formats. They were written primarily by Shaun McCance.

The XSLT files are released under the terms of the GNU LGPL. You may build
customizations from these stylesheets using their public documented interfaces,
using either xsl:import or xsl:include, with no restrictions on your customized
stylesheets. You may also invoke the stylesheets freely, either with a simple
XSLT processor such as xsltproc, or using an XSLT processing library within
your program. The use of these stylesheets has no bearing on the licensing
terms of the XSLT processing program you use.

The files output by the stylesheets are not affected by the terms of the LGPL.
In particular, some of the stylesheets output program files rather than simple
data files. The generated program files are also not affected by the LGPL.
You can redistribute all generated files as you see fit.


Images
------
This package contains a number of images that are used in the formatted
output. They were created primarily by Shaun McCance. These images are
licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL.

As a special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you distribute
copies of your document formatted by the tools in this package, you may
redistribute unmodified copies of any images used or referenced in that
formatted copy without restriction.


JavaScript
----------
This package contains a copy of the highlight.js JavaScript library for
syntax highlighting. This library is written by Josh Goebel and many
others, and is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license.

All other JavaScript falls under the licensing terms of the XSLT. It is
licensed under the GNU LGPL, but you may freely redistribute it when it
is included in files generated by the XSLT.
