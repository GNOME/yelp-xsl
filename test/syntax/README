This test shows the syntax highlighting for different languages in
different formats. yelp-xsl uses highlight.js for syntax highlighting.

To try things out, just make changes directly to the files in your
checkout of yelp-xsl. You don't have to build or install your copy
of yelp-xsl. Just build this preview document. To build this preview
document, just run:

  ./build.sh
