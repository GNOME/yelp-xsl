This test shows the colors provided by colors.xsl, including those
that can be automatically computed. It shows all foreground colors
on all background color, along with the WCAG contrast ratio to
ensure accessibility for various visual impairments.

To try things out, just make changes directly to the files in your
checkout of yelp-xsl. You don't have to build or install your copy
of yelp-xsl. Just build this preview document. To build this preview
document, just run:

  ./build.sh
