This document is intended to test out different features and style
changes for Mallard documents. If you need to test things not in
this document, feel free to add stuff to this document.

To try things out, just make changes directly to the files in your
checkout of yelp-xsl. You don't have to build or install your copy
of yelp-xsl. Just build this preview document. To build this preview
document, just run:

  ./build.sh

You do need yelp-tools installed for the yelp-build command. It's in
your distro's packages, and you might have it installed already anyway.
