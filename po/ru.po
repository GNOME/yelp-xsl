#. This is a format message used to format inline quotations.  This template

#. notation for nested quotations.
#.
#. These stylesheets only provide two levels of quotation formatting.  If
#. quote elements are nested deeper, the stylesheets will alternate between
#. the 'outer' and 'inner' roles.  If your language uses different formatting
#. for deeper quotations, please contact the maintainers, and we will try to
#. implement a more flexible formatting mechanism.
