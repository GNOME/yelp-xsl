#. This is an image of the opening quotation character for your language.
#. The image is used as a watermark on blockquote elements.  There are a
#. number of different quote characters used by various languages, so the
#. image name is translatable.  The name of the icon should be of the form
#. "yelp-quote-XXXX.png", where XXXX is the Unicode code point of the opening
#. quote character.  For example, some languages use the double angle quotation
#. mark.  Translators for these languages should use "yelp-quote-00AB.png".
#. 
#. The image, however, is not automatically created.  Do not translate
#. this to a value if there isn't a corresponding file in yelp-xsl under
#. the directory icons/hicolor/48x48/status.
#. 
#. Languages that use guillemets (angle quotation marks) should use either
#. 00AB or 00BB, depending on whether the opening quotation is the left
#. guillemet or the right guillemet.  Languages that use inverted comma
#. quotation marks should use 201C, 201D, or 201E.  Single quotation marks
#. don't make very nice watermarks, so if you would normally open a quote
#. with single quotation marks in your language, use the corresponding
#. double quotation mark for the watermark image.
